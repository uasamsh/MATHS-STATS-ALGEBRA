    "The given set of numbers is 5, 8, 12, 15, 22.\n",

    "### 7. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 on a standard six-sided die?\n",
    "\n",
    "rolling a 5 or 6, as these numbers are greater than 4. The total number of possible outcomes is 6 since there are six sides on the die.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n",
    "Probability = 2 / 6\n",
    "Probability = 1 / 3\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 on a standard six-sided die is 1/3 or approximately 0.333.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. If a coin is flipped three times, what is the probability of getting exactly two heads?\n",
    "\n",
    "When flipping a fair coin, the probability of getting a head or a tail on any given flip is 1/2 or 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the probability of getting exactly two heads when flipping a coin three times, we need to consider the number of ways this outcome can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, there are three possible outcomes where exactly two heads occur: HHT, HTH, and THH. The remaining outcome would be TTT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each flip is independent, the probability of a specific outcome occurring is the product of the probabilities of each individual flip. Therefore, the probability of each of the three outcomes with exactly two heads is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability of HHT = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n",
    "Probability of HTH = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n",
    "Probability of THH = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding up the probabilities of these three outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability of exactly two heads = (1/8) + (1/8) + (1/8) = 3/8\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability of getting exactly two heads when flipping a coin three times is 3/8 or approximately 0.375.\n",

    "### 9. Draw a bar graph to represent the number of pets owned by a group of seven friends: 1, 0, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Pets   |    Frequency\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "       0         |       ■\n",
    "       1         |    ■■■\n",
    "       2         |    ■■\n",
    "       3         |     ■\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "Certainly! The bar graph represents the number of pets owned by a group of seven friends. Here's an explanation of each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "- X-axis: The x-axis represents the categories or values being considered, which in this case is the number of pets owned. The categories are 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Y-axis: The y-axis represents the frequency or count of friends who fall into each category. It shows the number of friends in the group who own a specific number of pets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bars: The bars in the graph represent the frequency of each category. The height or length of each bar corresponds to the number of friends falling into that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frequency: The frequency is the number of friends in the group who fall into each category. It is represented by the number of bars (■) for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given graph, the category \"0\" has one friend who owns zero pets, represented by a single bar. The category \"1\" has three friends who own one pet, represented by three bars. The category \"2\" has two friends who own two pets, represented by two bars. The category \"3\" has one friend who owns three pets, represented by a single bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the bar graph provides a visual representation of the distribution of the number of pets owned by the group of seven friends, allowing for easy comparison between the different categories.\n",
