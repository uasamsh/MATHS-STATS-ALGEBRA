    "### 1. Convert 50 centimeters to inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to convert 50 centimeters to inches, we divide 50 by 2.54:\n",
    "\n",
    "50 cm ÷ 2.54 cm/inch = 19.685 inches\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is the perimeter of a rectangle with length 6 units and width 4 units?\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the perimeter, we can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)\n",
    "\n",
    "Perimeter = 2 * (6 + 4)\n",
    "Perimeter = 2 * 10\n",
    "Perimeter = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Calculate the area of a triangle with base 5 units and height 3 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Area = (base * height) / 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Area = (5 * 3) / 2\n",
    "Area = 15 / 2\n",
    "Area = 7.5\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Find the volume of a cube with edges measuring 3 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 * 3 * 3 = 27 \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is the circumference of a circle with a radius of 4 units?\n",
    "\n",
    "Circumference = 2 * π * 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an approximate value of π ≈ 3.14159, we can calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Circumference ≈ 2 * 3.14159 * 4\n",
    "Circumference ≈ 6.28318 * 4\n",
    "Circumference ≈ 25.13272\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the circumference of the circle with a radius of 4 units is approximately 25.13272 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. How many milliliters are in 3 liters?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 1000 milliliters are in 1 liter\n",
    "\n",
    "1000 * 3 = 3000 milliliters\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. If a room is 12 feet by 15 feet, what is the area in square yards?\n",
    "\n",
    "Area in square feet = 12 feet * 15 feet = 180 square feet\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert the area of a room from square feet to square yards, we need to divide the area in square feet by 9\n",
    "because (1 yard = 3 feet, so 1 yard * 1 yard = 3 feet * 3 feet = 9 square feet).\n",
    "\n",
    "square feet 180/9 = 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of the room measuring 12 feet by 15 feet is 20 square yards\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Convert a temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Celsius = (Fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Celsius = (95 - 32) * (5/9)\n",
    "Celsius = 63 * (5/9)\n",
    "Celsius ≈ 35 degree\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Calculate the area of a trapezoid with bases of 6 and 4 units and a height of 3 units.\n",
    "The values into the formula:\n",
    "Area = (base1 + base2) * height / 2\n",
    "Area = (6 + 4) * 3 / 2\n",
    "Area = 10 * 3 / 2\n",
    "Area = 30 / 2\n",
    "Area = 15\n",
    "\n",
    "10. A car’s odometer reads 22,300.5 miles. If the car travels another 123.25 miles, what will the odometer read?\n",
    "\n",
    "we can find the final reading by adding the two values together.\n",
    "\n",
    "22,300.5 miles + 123.25 miles = 22,423.75 miles\n",
    "\n"
