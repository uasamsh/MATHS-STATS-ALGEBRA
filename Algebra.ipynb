    "# Algebra\n",
    " Algebrais a branch of mathematics that uses to symbols and letters to represent the number and quatities in folrmulae and equations.\n",
    "## Diiferent Terminologies in ALgebra\n",
    "\n",
    "1.` Arithemtics`: Branch of mathematics wich deals with basic operations. For Example: +,-,/,* ......\n",
    "2.` Variables` : A symbol or of an letter that presents unknown number . For Example: x = ? symbols show (? means-->) unknown number is called variable. . For Example: 5 + x = 10 , Find x, x is variable.\n",
    "3.  `Expression`: 3X +1 and 5x + 1 is called Expression. What is Expression that is called a Mathematical phrase like i am John, in methematics phrase we write in numbers like 5 + 1 when we write a number with variable like 5x + 1 then it is called Expression 5 and 1 is number x is variable + is arithmetics opr.\n",
    " `In ALGEBRA` we deals with Expressions.\n",
    "   `Algebraic expression`: A combination of variables and constants involved in an operation or equation. It is a representation of the solution\n",
    "4. `Equation`: A MAthmetical statement in which numbers , variables and +, - . when we write number + var then it is called Expression . when 2 in Expression are equals like 5x + 1 = 11, 5(2)+ 1 = 11 then 11 is Expression 2.\n",
    "    Sometimes we have 2 Expression like 5x + 1 is 5x + 1 Expression 1 and y + 3 is Expression 2, this will make an equation.\n",
    "5. `Solving the equation`: We find out variable or unknown value.\n",
    " \n",
    "# Why Algebra is important in computer Scince?\n",
    "1. Problem Solving 5 + ? = 10\n",
    "2. Critical Thinking 5 + 5 = 10\n",
    "3. Foundation for Advance Study\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to aproach algebra means how to learn.\n",
    "1. Learn Basic Operations/Arithmetics and their meaning.\n",
    "2. Practice Regularly\n",
    "3. Seek help When stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of Algebra\n",
    "1. `Pre-algebra `: means first of all what should learn, Basic Arithemtics opr, fractions, decimals, and introductory algebra concepts.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. `Elemnetray Algera`:\n",
    "  The most basic form of algebra focusing on fundamental concepts of algebra expressions, equations, and working with variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.` Intremediate Algebra`: A continuation of elemntory algebra inroducing more complex equations, quaratic equatoins, exponential equations, and logrimethics expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `Linear Algebra` : Deals with `Vectors`, Linear transformatins, and system of linear equations, fundamental in many areas of mathematics and applied sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `Abstract/ Modren Algebra`: Explore algebraic structure like groups, rings, and fields, delving into the properties of opretions and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Boolean algebra : Boolean algebra is a branch of algebra that deals with binary variables and logical operations. it is imp.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `Relational Algebra like SQL`: Relational algebra is a mathematical framework for manipulating and querying relational databases. utilized in database theory. focusing on sets, relations, and operations to process and query data in database.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. `Computational Algebra`: Solving Algebric problems using computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. `Homologic Algebra`: Studies homology and cohomology groups. like separate male and female. use in clustering.\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. `Universal Algebra`: Studies properties common to all algebric structures. \n",
