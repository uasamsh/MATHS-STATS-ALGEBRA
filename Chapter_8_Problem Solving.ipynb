    "### 1. A recipe calls for 3 cups of flour for every 4 cups of sugar. How much sugar is needed if 6 cups of flour are used?\n",
    "\n",
    "3 cups of flour / 4 cups of sugar = 6 cups of flour / x cups of sugar\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the value of \"x,\" we can cross-multiply:\n",
    "\n",
    "3 cups of flour * x cups of sugar = 6 cups of flour * 4 cups of sugar\n",
    "\n",
    "3x = 24\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing both sides by 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. An art piece is sold for $120, which is a 20% profit over the cost. What was the cost price?\n",
    "\n",
    "Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit\n",
    "\n",
    "$120 = C + 20% of C\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate 20% of C, we multiply C by 0.20:\n",
    "\n",
    "$120 = C + 0.20C\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining like terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$120 = 1.20C\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can solve for C by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:\n",
    "\n",
    "C = $120 / 1.20\n",
    "\n",
    "C = $100\n",

    "### 3. A rectangular garden has a length of 20 meters and a width that is half of its length. What is the area of the garden?\n",
    "\n",
    "the length of the garden is 20 meters, we can determine the width by dividing the length by 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Width = Length / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10 meters\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can calculate the area:\n",
    "\n",
    "Area = Length × Width = 20 × 10 = 200 square meters\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. If 3 pencils cost 45 cents, how much would 10 pencils cost?\n",
    "\n",
    "3 pencils * x cents = 45 cents * 10 pencils\n",
    "\n",
    "3x = 450\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing both sides by 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 150\n",

    "### 5. You have a rope 30 meters long, and you need to cut it into pieces that are 2.5 meters each. How many pieces can you cut?\n",
    "\n",
    "Total length of the rope = 30 meters\n",
    "Length of each piece = 2.5 meters\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of pieces = Total length of the rope / Length of each piece\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of pieces = 30 meters / 2.5 meters\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of pieces = 12\n",

    "### 7. Mike read twice as many books this year as last year. If he read 5 books last year, how many books did he read this year?\n",
    "\n",
    "If Mike read twice as many books this year as last year, and he read 5 books last year, we can determine the number of books he read this year by multiplying the number of books he read last year by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of books read this year = 5 books * 2 = 10 books\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Solve for x in the equation 5x − 6 = 2x + 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "5x - 2x = 9 + 6\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "3x = 15\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. A box contains red and blue marbles. If the ratio of red to blue marbles is 3:4 and there are 12 red marbles, how many blue marbles are there?\n",
    "\n",
    "3 red marbles / 4 blue marbles = 12 red marbles / x blue marbles\n",
    "\n",
    "3x = 4 * 12\n",
    "3x = 48\n",
    "x = 48/3\n",
    "x = 16\n",
    "There are 16 blue marbles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. If the price of a jacket after tax is $108 and the tax rate is 8%, what is the original price of the jacket before tax?\n",
    "\n",
    "P + 0.08P = $108\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining like terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.08P = $108\n",
    "\n",
    "Dividing both sides by 1.08:\n",
    "\n",
    "P = $108 / 1.08\n",
    "\n",
    "P ≈ $100\n",

    "### 11. Convert a speed of 60 miles per hour to feet per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "1 mile = 5280 feet\n",
    "1 hour = 3600 seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert 60 miles per hour to feet per second, we can set up the conversion as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(60 miles/hour) * (5280 feet/mile) * (1 hour/3600 seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying the units, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "(60 * 5280) feet/3600 seconds\n",

    "Simplifying further:\n",
    "\n",
    "88 feet/second\n",

    "### 12. How many different outfits can you make with 4 shirts and 3 pairs of pants?\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of outfits = Number of shirt options * Number of pants options\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of outfits = 4 shirts * 3 pairs of pants\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of outfits = 12\n",

    "### 13. Calculate the surface area of a cylinder with a radius of 3 units and a height of 5 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The curved surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n",
    "Cylinder CSA = 2 * π * radius * height\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of each base of the cylinder is given by the formula:\n",
    "Cylinder Base Area = π * radius^2\n",
    "\n",
    "Radius = 3 units\n",
    "Height = 5 units\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the curved surface area:\n",
    "Cylinder CSA = 2 * π * 3 * 5\n",

    "Calculating the area of each base:\n",
    "Cylinder Base Area = π * 3^2\n",
    "Cylinder Base Area = 9 * π\n",
    "\n",
    "The total surface area of the cylinder is the sum of the curved surface area and the area of the two bases:\n",
    "Cylinder Surface Area = Cylinder CSA + 2 * Cylinder Base Area\n",
    "Cylinder Surface Area = 30 * π + 2 * (9 * π)\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying:\n",
    "Cylinder Surface Area = 30π + 18π\n",
    "Cylinder Surface Area = 48π\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the surface area of the cylinder with a radius of 3 units and a height of 5 units is 48π square units.\n",

    "### 14. A bookstore offers a 15% discount on a book that originally costs $35. What is the discount amount?\n",
    "\n",
    "discount 15/100 = 0.15\n",
    "0.15 * 35 = 5.25\n",
    "\n",
    "Discount amount = $5.25\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the discount amount on a book originally priced at $35 with a 15% discount is $5.25.\n",

    "### 15. If you have a square plot of land with an area of 49 square meters, what is the perimeter of the plot?\n",
    "\n",
    "The area of the square plot is 49 square meters, we can find the length of one side by taking the square root of the area.\n",
