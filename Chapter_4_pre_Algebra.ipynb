    "### 1. Convert the fraction 3/5 to a percentage.\n",
    "   3/5 * 100 = (3 * 100) / 5 = 300/5 = 60\n",
    "   the fraction 3/5 is equivalent to 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Change 40% to a decimal.\n",
    "   40% = 40/100 = 0.4\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is 25% of 200?\n",
    " 25% of 200\n",
    " 25/100 * 200= 50\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. If a dress costs $70 after a 30% discount, what was the original price?\n",
    "\n",
    "The original price as \"x\".\n",
    "After a 30% discount, the discounted price is 70 dollars, which is equal to 70% of the original price. \n",
    "70% of x = $70\n",
    "0.70x = $70\n",
    "x = $70 / 0.70\n",
    "x = $100\n",
    "The original price of the dress was $100.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. A population of 50,000 increases by 5% per year. What is the population after one year?\n",
    "   5% = 5/100 = 0.05\n",
    "   The increase in population over one year is 0.05*50000 = 2500 people.\n",
    "   So, the population after one year would be 50000 + 2500 = 52500.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Calculate the percentage decrease if a productâ€™s price drops from $200 to $150.\n",
    "   $200 - $150/$200 *100= 25%\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Find 150% of 60.\n",
    " 150/100 = 1.5 * 60 = 90\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8.What percentage of a day is 6 hours?\n",
    " \n",
    "  To find the percentage, we can set up a proportion:\n",
    "   6 hours / 24 hours = x / 100%\n",
    "   To find the percentage, we can set up a proportion\n",
    "    6/24,  x/100\n",
    "    600 = 24x\n",
    "    600/24 = x/24 OR\n",
    "    x = 600/24\n",
    "    x = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. If you save $20 on a $50 item, what percent discount is that?\n",
    "   Percent discount = ($20 / $50) * 100 = 40%\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 10. A score of 80% is needed to pass a test. If the test has 50 questions, how many questions must you answer correctly?\n",
    "  80% is equivalent to 0.8 as a decimal.\n",
    "  80/100 = 0.8\n",
    "  0.8 *50 =  40 \n",
    "  At least 40 questions correctly in order to pass the test."
